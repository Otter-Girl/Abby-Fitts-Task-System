This is the tutorial on how to make an Abby Fitts Task System block!

Please check out the manuel first as it will clear up any terminology questions you may have. 
The page for this section is p.[insert page number here].

This tutorial and the accompanying function blockMaker.m will guide you through making your very first blockData.mat file. 
blockData.mat files tell Abby what stimulus to present.

You can see from the manuel that the top row and the last two collumns of a blockData.mat file are clerical information. 
This information is implict in the data you see in the rest of the block. 
We include this data for clarity and to help Abby do checks and balences. 
Check which will ensure your testing runs smoothly an produces acurate results.

To make your first blockData.mat load the myFirstBlock.mat in matlab and open the "blockData" variable.
blockData is the keyword Abby will look for when trying to make stimuli.
Make sure the variable stored in your .mat files is called blockData, written exactly like that!
 
All you need to do is fill in the parameters you want for an nx6 matrix (where n = number of trials + 1).
myFirstBlock.mat has the minimum required information to create a fully functioning block.
Take note that none of the "nessesary" data required for Abby to run is presant. 
blockMaker.m will do all that work for you! 
If you get confused about what goes where just take another look at the manuel.

To fill out the rest of the block just type
>> blockMaker(blockData, "filename")
into the MATLAB command line.

If there are no errors (which blockMaker will tell you about if there is!)
you should see your matrix change in the variable window in MATLAB.
Once this is done simply type
>> save("yourfilenamehere.mat", "blockData")
into command line.
N.B. You must make the file a .mat file, otherwise Abby wont be able to access your block data!
