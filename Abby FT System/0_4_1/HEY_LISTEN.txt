This is a quick introduction to the Abby Fitts Task System. 
If you haven't read the user manuel I suggest you do that now.

You can see three folders and some files, I will explain the folders.

	First is the Data folder. 
	This holds all the information you will collect while making Fitts Trails.
	The data folders are all made automatically.

	Second is the functions folder.
	This holds all the functions the Abby system needs.
	Feel free to poke around if you're familiar with MATLAB.

	Third is the SessionImport folder.
	Please check this one out! 
	Check out the tutorial on how to make your own Fitts Task matrix.

Now that you're done having a look through the folders and your curiosity is sated, let's look at the scripts
There should be two scripts at the moment.

	First you should run initialise.m.
	This will set up the Abby system on your computer.
	It will ensure Abby runs correctly for the duration of your research.

	Second is Abby.
	Run this file when you want to do research.
	If you have any questions contact the programmer at harry.carr@dcu.ie.
	She will answer all your questions.
